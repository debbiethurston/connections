Takeaway and documentation from Rx2019 presentation "Optimizing Connection Requests: From Inquiry to Application to Placement" by Eddie  Holeman and Debbie Thurston. Keep in mind that these files are not listed in the order of process.  The Interest Form kicks off the process that then moves to a connection request.  From there, the staff member can send an email, send a text, or send the serving application link. Then, based on the opportunity type from which the serving application link is sent, the appropriate application is sent.

Application_Serving_Interest Form, as stated above, is the first step in the process from the vantage of a potential volunteer.

Application_Serving Step 1 is the first step in the actual application (remember the volunteer starts with an interest form, not the application). 

Application_Serving Audlt Worship contains the application workflow for those who are applying for Worship.  The questions are very much geared for music-related volunteers.

Application_Serving_Care is the application workflow used for basic information gathering and is used for any area that is not specific.

Application_Serving Final is used by all the application for serving as it contains the workflow with the basic serving requirements as well as leads the applicant through the background form.

Application_Serving Kids, as with the Worship Application, also has questions specific to serving with kids and students.

Application_Serving Saftey Team has a few extra questions regarding the type of safety/emergency background the person may have.

Application_Serving Womens' Mentors not only links to the questions that are specific for the role, but contains a link that takes the applicant to a page of expectations.

The Send Email, Send Serving Application and Send Text are workflows triggered from within the connection request.
